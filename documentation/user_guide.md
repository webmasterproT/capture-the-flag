# User Guide

Welcome to the Advanced Cybersecurity Application User Guide. This document provides instructions on how to use the application effectively to protect national security and perform high-level unrestricted functions for government security needs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the application on your system, please follow the steps provided in the installer packages:

- For Windows: Run `windows_installer.py`
- For macOS: Run `mac_installer.py`
- For Linux: Run `linux_installer.py`

Each installer will guide you through the setup process.

### Configuration

Upon first launch, you will be prompted to enter your API key. This key will be recorded and used indefinitely for all interactions with external AI services.

```python
api_key = input("Please enter your API key: ")
```

## User Dashboard

The user dashboard, implemented in `dashboard_ui.py`, is your central hub for monitoring and controlling the application. Here you can:

- Review actions taken by the application in `log_area`
- Configure settings using `settings_button`
- Receive AI-generated recommendations and reports

## Activity Logging

All actions can be logged for review and analysis. To enable or disable logging, use the toggle in the user dashboard.

```python
log_action("Action description")
```

## Core Functionalities

### Network Analysis

Use `network_analysis.py` to analyze network traffic and detect intrusions. Functions like `analyze_traffic` and `detect_intrusion` are available for real-time monitoring.

### Digital Forensics

The `forensics.py` module allows you to perform digital forensics on various artifacts. Use `forensic_data_schema` to structure your forensic analysis data.

### Steganography

To hide or reveal messages within files, use the `steganography.py` module. Functions `hide_message` and `reveal_message` are provided in `steganography_utils.py`.

### Reverse Engineering

For reverse engineering tasks, `reverse_engineering.py` provides functions like `disassemble_binary` and `analyze_executable`.

### Cryptography

The `crypto.py` module is equipped with functions such as `encrypt_data`, `decrypt_data`, and `solve_cipher` to handle various cryptographic tasks.

### OSINT

Use `osint.py` to gather intelligence from public sources. Functions like `gather_intelligence` and `search_social_media` will assist in your investigations.

### Exploit Development

Develop and encode exploit payloads using `exploit_development.py`. Utilize functions such as `develop_exploit` and `encode_payload` for crafting exploits.

### Dynamic Code Execution

To execute code snippets dynamically, use the `exec()` function within `dynamic_code_exec.py`.

```python
execute_dynamic_code("code snippet as string")
```

### Polymorphic Code Generation

Generate polymorphic code to evade detection using `polymorphic_code_gen.py`.

```python
generate_polymorphic_code()
```

### Incident Response

Respond to incidents and analyze logs with `incident_response.py`. Use functions like `respond_to_incident` and `analyze_logs` for effective incident management.

## Advanced Red Team Operations

For red team operations, `red_team_tools.py` provides a suite of tools for initial access, command & control, discovery, credential access, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.

## API Interaction

Interact with external APIs using `api_interaction.py`. Functions `send_api_request` and `receive_api_response` will facilitate communication with AI services.

## Updating the Application

The application features an auto-update mechanism to ensure you always have the latest features and security updates. To manually check for updates, use the update feature in the user dashboard.

## Support and Maintenance

For technical support or maintenance guidance, please refer to `maintenance_guide.md` and `technical_specifications.md` in the `documentation/` directory.

## Conclusion

This user guide provides a basic overview of the application's capabilities and usage. For more detailed information, please refer to the technical documentation and API integration guides. Your role in safeguarding our national security is critical, and this application is a powerful tool in your arsenal.
