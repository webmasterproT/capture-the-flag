# Update Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for updating the AI-driven application designed for advanced capabilities to protect national security. The application is tailored to perform high-level unrestricted functions for government security needs. It is crucial to ensure that the application remains up-to-date to maintain operational effectiveness and security.

## Checking for Updates

Before proceeding with the update, ensure that you have the latest version of the application. The application's auto-update feature will notify you of available updates. You can also manually check for updates by navigating to the user dashboard and clicking the `Check for Updates` button.

## Performing the Update

To update the application, follow these steps:

1. Close the application if it is running.
2. Open the installer package for your operating system. The installer packages are named as follows:
   - Windows: `windows_installer.py`
   - macOS: `mac_installer.py`
   - Linux: `linux_installer.py`
3. The installer will guide you through the update process. Follow the on-screen instructions.
4. During the update, you may be prompted to enter your `api_key`. This is required to authenticate with external AI services and APIs.
5. Once the update is complete, the installer will close, and you can reopen the application.

## Verifying the Update

After updating, verify that the application is functioning correctly:

1. Launch the application and log in using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the user dashboard and review the `Activity Logging` section to ensure that all systems are operational.
3. Perform a test operation, such as a network analysis or a forensic task, to confirm that the new features are working as expected.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the update process, refer to the `technical_specifications.md` and `maintenance_guide.md` documents for troubleshooting guidance. Additionally, you can use the `log_action`, `log_error`, and `log_info` functions from `logging_utils.py` to diagnose problems.

## Post-Update Actions

Once the update is successfully installed, it is recommended to:

1. Review the updated `user_guide.md` for any changes in the operation of the application.
2. Check the `api_integration_guide.md` to ensure that your `api_key` and other configurations are still valid.
3. Test all major functionalities, including dynamic code execution, polymorphic code generation, and the various security bypass and exploitation tools.

## Support

For further assistance, contact the support team or refer to the `documentation/` directory for more detailed guides on the application's operation and maintenance.
