This code provides a basic structure for the `external_tools/exploit_tools.py` file, including methods for creating and encoding an exploit payload, deploying the exploit, executing exploit code, and reverse engineering binaries. The actual implementation details for encoding and deploying exploits would need to be developed according to the specific requirements and capabilities of the system. The `reverse_engineer_binary` function is a placeholder that uses `radare2` for reverse engineering, which would need to be installed on the system where this tool is used.
